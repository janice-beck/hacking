                <h3>  I tried to make a font that looks "normal" on screen but 
                    changes after export when printed — a small act of misbehaving type. 
                    It didn’t  work as planned. Turns out, fonts are deeply conservative technologies designed for stability (no surprise). This process exposed the limits of authorship in typography: I could design an alternative behavior, but I couldn’t control when (or if) it would appear. Ironically, the only way to make the effect visible was to manually intervene. 
                    <br> The Image below shows the idea.

                    This felt like a waste of time and was very frustrating. However, I experienced a moment of joy while I was attacking the DIN typeface.                </h3>
