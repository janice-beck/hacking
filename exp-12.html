                    <h3>In this experiment, I sought out three different sources and combined them in new ways. At first, this felt strange, but if we’re honest, it’s not that far from how things really work.

                        We consume an overwhelming amount of content, and many designers rely on mood boards or references. Yet, there’s a certain shame attached to admitting it, as if it undermines the pride we take in claiming something as “our idea.”
                        
                        This experiment questions that pride — not as a critique of authorship, but as an invitation to consider the shared nature of creative work.</h3>
