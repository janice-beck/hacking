            <h3>This project reframes graphic design through the lens of hacking – not as breaking code, but as a curious, critical mode of engaging with systems. Drawing from early hacker culture, it treats every component of design; tools, workflows, authorship, even identity, as a system that can be inspected, questioned, and subtly misused. Through a series of experimental interventions, hacking becomes a method for exposing the invisible defaults that shape contemporary graphic design practice. These experiments are not polished solutions but probes: actions that surface the assumptions we rarely notice.
This website serves as both process documentation and an evolving archive of these experiments. Its source code is openly accessible on GitHub, inviting anyone to examine, fork, and reinterpret the project’s underlying structure. </h3>
