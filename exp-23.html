                <h3> What you see is what you get. We always design in preview. It feels so natural, I almost overlooked it — but it’s a crucial part of designing: the visual, the act of seeing. In Figma, you can turn opacity down to 0%. That’s what I did. I kept the familiar interface, the tools, the canvas — just removed the preview.
                    
                    <br><br>
                    It was strange at first, but I really enjoyed it. Designing without seeing forced a different kind of attention. I couldn’t rely on how things looked, only on how they were structured. 
                    And every outcome was a suprise until the end!<br>

Of course, I could have pushed it further: more pages, more content, more time. Maybe I will.</h3>
