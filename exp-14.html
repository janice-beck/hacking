                    <h3>Hackers often learn by reverse engineering: analyzing, dissecting, breaking things down, then building them back up.

                        I transferred that process to graphic design: I took apart an existing poster and reassembled its elements into new images.
                        
                        This wasn’t just about form, but about understanding structure — seeing design not as a finished object, but as something that can be broken, studied, and remade.</h3>
