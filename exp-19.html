                <h3>  This experiment explored the collapse and reconfiguration of 
                    typographic hierarchy through scripting. By writing a Python script for 
                    Scribus, I intervened in the logic of desktop publishing, usually 
                    ruled by precision and logic, to introduce random placements. 
                    The machine arranges language: headline, subline, and copytext are 
                    put on the page without regard for traditional order or 
                    readability. The result is a visual negotiation between 
                    structure and misbehavior. <br><br>
                This felt good, but i also got bored soon. I could have experimented more
                with different paragraph styles or longer text over multiple plages. But i think the concept 
                is tangible. Also interesting: the randomness made me want to intervene afterwards–not really to fix it, it was just somehow inviting.                 </h3>

                            2. Used external .txt files to load structured content: headline, subline, body text. <br>
                            3. Created and positioned text frames dynamically within A4 page boundaries.<br>
                            4. Applied predefined paragraph styles (HEAD, SUB, COPY) to each text block.<br>
5. Focused on controlled unpredictability (playing)
