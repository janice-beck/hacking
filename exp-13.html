                        What interested me was how different it felt from my usual way of working — I realized how fixed my own habits have become. Copying revealed how narrow my design reflexes can be.
                        
                        It was also telling that the source was relatively old. Once again, it raised questions about reuse, authorship, and what we really mean when we talk about originality.</h3>
