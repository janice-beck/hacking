                <section id="steckbrief">
                    <h3> I took an excerpt from an interview and laid it out 
                      across different design programs, using only the default 
                      settings: default typefaces, colors, grids. The idea was
                      simple: I wanted to test how much the software designs when 
                      I step back as a designer, or as the “author.” 
                        Across all Programms, I hated the process and the results. I felt like a bad designer. 
                      It was demotivating, I didn’t want to keep workinng, I stopped before I was visually satisfied. This usually never happens to me.
                      <br><br>
                      I was completely alienated from my output.
                      What made it worse: even with all these constraints, I still had to make decisions—just less informed, less meaningful ones.
                      <br><br>
                      At first, I thought this experiment would be about my 
                      process. But in the end, it was more about my self-image. 
                    It raised questions:    
                      What does it mean when I don’t design? 
                  Who am I if the outcome is bad? 
                  This experiment became a confrontation with my own expectations, ego, and discomfort in letting go of authorship and aesthetic control.</h3>
