                <h3> I hijacked the HTML structure
                    of a public domain book and made small interventions to
                    turn it into a zine (Process Documentation of Experiments)           
                    <a href="exp-15.html" target="_blank" >4.1</a> and                     
                        <a href="exp-16" target="_blank" >4.2</a>



                    . 
                    
                    <br>I reused existing code, inserted
                    my content, and shaped the layout using the browser’s
                    print preview and settings—no design software involved.
                    I gave up control as a designer and let the system and
                    the existing file shape a big part of the outcome. That
                    loss of control also questions authorship: where does
                    design start when you’re only editing what’s already
                    there? 
                    <br>
                    The zine is transparent about
                    its making—like a good hack, it shows its process. It’s
                    fast publishing, low-tech and hands-on. Even the paper
                    is hacked—made entirely from free samples offered by
                    the big paper supplier of the school. Nothing is
                    original, but everything is repurposed with intent.

                    I enjoyed this experiment. I felt like it is well aligned with my overall concept. It was also nice to review the workshop results one more time. I liked the feeling of autonomy. The hard part: aesthetically, it doesn’t go with the expectations I have of my output, 
                    but breaking or questioning those is also a part of this project.

                            1. Downloaded a base HTML file of a book from Project Gutenberg to use as a
structural template.<br>
2. Opened the file in a code editor (VS Code) replaced original book content
with my own content.<br>
3. Tweaked the HTML briefly to fit my design needs (headings, font, etc.),
constantly previewed layout using the print preview in the browser.<br>
4. Used the browser's print preview/settings to control layout and inherent
pagination (e.g., A4 size, margins, orientation).<br>
Iteratively edited HTML → saved → checked print preview → repeated.
Let the browser’s native print engine handle pagination—no JavaScript or printspecific
CSS used.
