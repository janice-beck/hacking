                <h3> This thesis is an experiment in structure and process. Typically, the written part of a design thesis is expected to follow a linear order: first, theoretical framing and literature; then, documentation and reflection on a practical project that is often completed after the written submission. Theory first, practice later. 
                    <br> I want to question that separation.
                    Instead, I treat the thesis as a live, ongoing process—reading, writing, experimenting and analysing in parallel. Like hacking, my method follows a loop: theory feeds experiment, experiment shifts perspective, reflection leads back into theory. This creates a non-linear structure where ideas come through action, and documentation becomes part of the work itself.
                    <br> By disrupting the expected order and merging practical and written elements, I try to question academic norms and explore how the thesis format can itself be hacked. 
                    <br>
                    To me, this approach feels natural. I see writing not just as a container for theory but as a tool—part of the design process itself. The strict division between theory and practice in design education has always felt artificial. ’m not sure yet how clearly it will all come together, or if it will be too confusing—but this uncertainty is part of the experiment.
